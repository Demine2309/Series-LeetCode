13. Roman to Integer

- Similar like the 12th problem. The only difference is that it converts from roman to integer.

 * Example 1:
    Input: s = "III"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: III = 3.

 * Example 2:
    Input: s = "LVIII"
    Output: 58
    Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

 * Example 3:
    Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
    Output: 1994
    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

** Solution:
    public class Solution
    {
        public int RomanToInt(string s)
        {

        }
    }
